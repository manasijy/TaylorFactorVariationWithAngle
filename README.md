# TaylorFactorVariationWithAngle
To calculate Taylor factor variation with angle from rolling direction from texture file. It also calculates lankford parameter (rvalue) for a given texture as well as its variation with tensile specimen orientation with respect to rolling direction.
It should be noted that this repo is useful for sheet products and tensile loading.
Main file is Mtheta.
Input is only the texture file. A few examples .txt files are included. Some of which have only single orientation and others have polycrystal data.
A function based on this function is also available on MTex. That one is compatible with MTex and more generalized.
These functions were developed a long time ago (and were available here in one of the other repositories - Taylor factor based programs etc.) so, might require minor changes for compatability with currect matlab verions.
